# Face Detection and FPS Display with OpenCV

This project implements real-time **face detection** using OpenCV's **Haar Cascade Classifier**. It also calculates and displays **Frames Per Second (FPS)** for performance monitoring.

## Features
- Uses **Haar Cascade Classifier** for face detection.
- **Draws bounding boxes** around detected faces.
- Calculates **real-time FPS** and overlays it on the video feed.
- Allows **capturing images** by pressing the **spacebar**.
- Press **ESC** to exit the application.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone <repo-url>
cd face-detection
